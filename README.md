  <h2>Exercise 01</h2>
  <p>
    <p>
        Manchester United FC has hired you as a developer. Develop a program that helps the coach identify their fastest player, player with the most goals, assists, passing accuracy, and defensive involvements.
    </p>
    <p>
        The system should also allow comparison between two players. Use the following player profiles:
    </p>
    <p>
        - Bruno Fernandes: 5 goals, 6 points in speed, 9 points in assists, 10 points in passing accuracy, 3 defensive involvements. Corresponds to jersey number 8.
        <br>- Rasmus Hojlund: 12 goals, 8 points in speed, 2 points in assists, 6 points in - passing accuracy, 2 defensive involvements. Corresponds to jersey number 11.
        <br>- Harry Maguire: 1 goal, 5 points in speed, 1 point in assists, 7 points in passing accuracy, 9 defensive involvements. Corresponds to jersey number 5.
        <br>- Alejandro Garnacho: 8 goals, 7 points in speed, 8 points in assists, 6 points in passing accuracy, 0 defensive involvements. Corresponds to jersey number 17.
        <br>- Mason Mount: 2 goals, 6 points in speed, 4 points in assists, 8 points in passing accuracy, 1 defensive involvement. Corresponds to jersey number 7.
    </p>
    <p>
        The program functions as follows. The coach accesses the system and encounters a menu with the following options:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Player Review: By entering the player's jersey number, they can access the player's characteristics.</li>
      <li>Compare two players: The system prompts for two jersey numbers and displays the data of both players on screen.</li>
      <li>Identify the fastest player: Displays the player with the most points in speed.</li>
      <li>Identify the top goal scorer: Displays the player with the most points in goals.</li>
      <li>Identify the player with the most assists: Displays the player with the most points in assists.</li>
      <li>Identify the player with the highest passing accuracy: Displays the player with the most points in passing accuracy.</li>
      <li>Identify the player with the most defensive involvements: Displays the player with the most points in defensive involvements.</li>
      <li>The system should also allow returning to the main menu.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Exercise 03</h2>
  <p>
    <p>
        The Valencia Hospital is developing an application to manage appointments. Design an algorithm for this application with the following features:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It must have a login and validate the data; after the third failed attempt, it should be locked.</li>
      <li>The user can schedule an appointment for: General Medicine, Emergency Care, Clinical Analysis, Cardiology, Neurology, Nutrition, Physiotherapy, Traumatology, and Internal Medicine.</li>
      <li>There are 3 doctors for each specialty.</li>
      <li>The user can only book one appointment per specialist. An error message should be displayed if the user tries to choose two appointments with the same doctor or the same specialty. As a developer, you can choose the doctors' names.</li>
      <li>The maximum limit for appointments, in general, is 3.</li>
      <li>Upon selecting a specialty, it will display if the user prefers a morning or afternoon appointment and show available hours. As a developer, you can choose the hours. Display available specialists.</li>
      <li>The user can choose their preferred specialist.</li>
      <li>The basic process is: Login -> Choose specialty -> Choose doctor -> Choose time slot.</li>
    </ul>

        The RH Hotels chain has hired you to design the booking algorithm for their mobile application:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Login; it should be locked after the third failed attempt.</li>
      <li>The RH Hotels chain exists in 5 countries: Spain, France, Portugal, Italy, and Germany.Each country has its own hotels located in: Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Munich, Berlin,Rome, Milan, Paris, Marseille, Madeira, Lisbon, and Porto.</li>
      <li>All hotels have 24 rooms each: 6 VIP suites, 3 single rooms, 6 double rooms, 6 group rooms, and 3 luxury suites.</li>
      <li>The user can make reservations at any time of the year and at any hour, and book as many rooms as desired.</li>

      <li>The algorithm functions as follows: Login, choose country, choose city, choose room type, select the number of nights, collect user data (name, surname, ID/passport), print the total cost, and if the user agrees, print a confirmation message for the reservation. If not, return to the main menu.</li>
